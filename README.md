NYC Bike Linear Regression
For this assignment, you’ll use the New York Bike Counts dataset to formulate a hypothesis about the number of bikes crossing the Brooklyn Bridge. This dataset contains the number of bikes that crossed each bridge during each day. You’ll first use this dataset to formulate a hypothesis and then use linear regression to test if your hypothesis was correct.
